            If you have stumbled onto this space without knowing me, I am Harinisri Balaji. 
I was born and brought up in Vellore. Havent went out of town much. 
I like to consider myself as<em> an ambivert</em> but really I'm just socially shy.
<br>I was born on 7 July 2005, same day as the legendary<strong> MS Dhoni</strong>. 
<br>I did my middle school education at <b>BMD Jain School</b>, started my High School at<strong> Sun Flower School</strong> and completed my Junior and Senior year at<strong> Velamayal School</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So, glad you asked.<br>
	As a self-proclaimed <em>bookworm</em>, I find joy in immersing myself in stories that transport me to different worlds. <br>
It all started with Ruskin Bond's Blue Umbrella, followed by the infamous Geronimo Stilton book series. Reading books made me feel alive. Like a breath of fresh air. Followed by years of book slump only to be broken when I reached my teenage era. If I could call a place as my second home, that would be my school library. 
<h3><i>"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies."</i></h3>
If you ask me my top three book in my favorite genre (<i>depressed girlies stories genre</i>), the following would be that:
	<ol><b>
 	<li>How to make Friends with the Dark by Kathleen Glasglow</li>
 	<li>A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara</li>
 	<li>Letters to the Lost by Brigid Kemmerer</li></b>
	</ol>
	Beyond academics and books, I'm a passionate ballet dancer, expressing myself through movements that tell a story is what makes it the best part.<strong> 	Cooking </strong> is another one of my cherished hobbies, where I try to experiment with flavors to create delightful dishes, which, hopefully doesnot give my friends a bad stomach. I'm also a music enthusiast, prone mostly to the genres that makes me want to dance till my feet hurt. I indulge in murder mysteries and crime documentaries that keeps me on the edge of my seat and scratches that invisible itch on my brain. (Again, I'm just a girl!) My favourite crime-based series is <em>Criminal Minds</em>, with the right amount of murder and pyschology!

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
            I'm a very curious person, which is both a good and a bad trait. Whether itâ€™s delving into the technicalities of IoT, perfecting my ballet moves, or penning down my latest story idea, I love approaching everything with enthusiasm and dedication. 	</p><br>
