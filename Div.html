        <h2 align="center">Hello there!</h2><br>
        <p align="right">If you have stumbled onto this space without knowing who's that pretty person in the picture is, I am <strong> Harinisri Balaji </strong>. Nice to meet you.
        <br> I was born on July 7, 2005, which makes me at the edge of my teen years at present. I spent most of my life here, at <i> Vellore</i>, where I was born and brought up. I like to consider myself an <em>Ambivert</em>, but really I'm just socially awkward just like any other teenage girl.
        </p><br>

        <p align="left">I’m currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science in the domain <strong> Internet of Things </strong> at
        Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I also have a huge interest in<strong><em> Psychology</em></strong>. I’m not an
        advanced coder, but I do have the basic knowledge in few Coding languages such as C++ and Java. I do like front-end development and currently working towards becoming a Web Developer. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are my Hobbies?</h3>
        <p>So, glad you asked.<br>
        As a self-proclaimed <em>bookworm</em>, I find joy in immersing myself in stories that transport me to different worlds. If you ask me my top three book in my favorite genre (<i>depressed girlies stories genre</i>), the following would be that:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ol><b>
          <li>How to make Friends with the Dark by Kathleen Glasglow</li>
          <li>A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara</li>
          <li>Letters to the Lost by Brigid Kemmerer</li></b>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
        Beyond academics and books, I'm a passionate ballet dancer, expressing myself through movements that tell a story.<strong> Cooking </strong> is another one of my cherished hobbies, where I try to experiment with flavors to create delightful dishes, which, hopefully does not give my friends a bad stomach. I'm also a music enthusiast. I do indulge in murder mysteries and crime documentaries that keeps me on the edge of my seat. My favourite crime-based series is <em>Criminal Minds</em>, with the right amount of murder and psychology!
        </p>

        <h3>So...</h3>
        <p>I'm a very curious person, which is a good and a bad trait. Whether it’s delving into the technicalities of IoT, perfecting my ballet moves, or penning down my latest story idea, I love approaching everything with enthusiasm and dedication. I have a vision to make my name in IoT projects and am working hard to make it come true.
