	<h2 align="center">Hello there!</h2><br>
	<p align="right">If you have stumbled onto this space without knowing who's that pretty person in the picture is, I am 	<strong> Harinisri Balaji </strong>. Nice to meet you.
	<br> I was born on July 7, 2005, which makes me at the edge of my teen years at present. I spent most of my life here, at <i>	Vellore</i>, where I was born and brought up. I like to consider myself an <em>Ambivert</em>, but really I'm just socially awkward (I'm just a girl). 
      </p><br>
      <div>
      <p align="right">I’m currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science in the domain  <strong> Internet of Things </strong> at
	Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I also have a huge interest in<strong><em> Psychology</em></strong>. I’m not an
	advanced coder, but I do have the basic knowledge in few Coding languages such as C++ and Java. I
	do like front-end development and currently working towards becoming a Web Developer. I do have a bit of an expertise on the hardware part of IoT.

      <h3>What are my Hobbies?</h3>
	<p>So, glad you asked.<br>
	As a self-proclaimed <em>bookworm</em>, I find joy in immersing myself in stories that transport me to different worlds. <br>
It all started with Ruskin Bond's Blue Umbrella, followed by the infamous Geronimo Stilton book series. Reading books made me feel alive. Like a breath of fresh air. Followed by years of book slump only to be broken when I reached my teenage era. If I could call a place as my second home, that would be my school library. 
<h3><i>"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies."</i></h3>
If you ask me my top three book in my favorite genre (<i>depressed girlies stories genre</i>), the following would be that:
	</p>
 	<p>
	<ol><b>
 	<li>How to make Friends with the Dark by Kathleen Glasglow</li>
 	<li>A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara</li>
 	<li>Letters to the Lost by Brigid Kemmerer</li></b>
	</ol>
	Beyond academics and books, I'm a passionate ballet dancer, expressing myself through movements that tell a story is what makes it the best part.<strong> 	Cooking </strong> is another one of my cherished hobbies, where I try to experiment with flavors to create delightful dishes, which, hopefully doesnot give my friends a bad stomach. I'm also a music enthusiast, prone mostly to the genres that makes me want to dance till my feet hurt. I indulge in murder mysteries and crime documentaries that keeps me on the edge of my seat and scratches that invisible itch on my brain. (Again, I'm just a girl!) My favourite crime-based series is <em>Criminal Minds</em>, with the right amount of murder and pyschology!

	<h3>So...</h3>
	<p>I'm a very curious person, which is both a good and a bad trait. Whether it’s delving into the technicalities of IoT, perfecting my ballet moves, or penning down my latest story idea, I love approaching everything with enthusiasm and dedication. 	</p><br>
