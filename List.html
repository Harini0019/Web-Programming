<dt><b>A little Life by Hanya Yanagihara</b></dt></center>
<dd><p>Depressing yet beautifully written, A little life is the story of four graduates who move to New York to make their way in life. Willem is an aspiring actor; Malcolm wants to be an architect but finds his job unfulfilling; JB is talented and trying to break his way into the art world; and Jude, an ambitious, brilliant lawyer, but deeply troubled.
Navigating through each of their lives, you may feel sad, angry, happy and relatable. 
Be prepared to have a tissue box nearby because your going to cry a river. This book is gut-wrenching and depressing but it potrayed life in a way thats raw and true. Truly worth a shot!</p></dd><br>

<dt><b>How to make Friends with the Dark by Kathleen Glasglow</b></dt></center>
<dd><p>There are too many scary things outside world. You may loose your loved ones, you can hurt yourself in several ways. You can lose your possessions, your social circles, your carrier or your dignity, patience, reputation.
But the scariest thing in life is loosing your inner light , turn it off forever and surrender to the dark!
<br>
This book is really pessimistic, depressing, heart wrenching! Too many times I thought to stop reading but I pushed myself to be patient. Because I know really well how to lose someone and suffer from deepest and never ever ending pain! <br>It never goes away because when you lose someone you lose some parts of yourselves and you turn into a different person.
So Grace a.k.a Tiger’s tragic journey after her loosing her mother is so realistic so sad but also so genuine, poignant and easy to connect.</p></dd>

<dt><b>Turtles All the Way Down by John Green</b></dt></center>
<dd><p>What if your stuck in your mind and you just spiral outta control all the time?<br>Well, Aza is stuck and she can't escape!
It really fell into the theme of spiraling down and down and down. She struggles with being stuck in her own head, bombarded by her obsessive thoughts, that sometimes made her do some crazy things. Something has been weighing on my mind for awhile; something I wanted to forget, but my mind would continue to grasp at it until it was the only thing swimming around in my thoughts. 
<br><br>
It got to the point that I would have inner dialogues with my own head trying to convince myself to believe one thing, but “someone” else would be trying to make me believe something else. I just wanted it to stop, but it felt out of my control; so I felt the frustration Aza was feeling at the times she would spiral down. Even if it’s not Aza who you relate with, I think there is someone in the book for every reader to relate to.</p></dd>
